## Setup
Any version of Python 3.6+ should work. To install the requirements, run: `pip3 install requirements.txt`.

## Week 1

The goal of week 1 is to learn about simple, yet powerful machine learning models. The first assignment is to train and host a Scalable Linear Support Vector Machine for handwritten digit classification. 
The second assignment is to use a linear regression to predict stock movement. It is shorter but focuses more on data rather than model architecture or inference.
